</h2>
<p>The Blessed Cultists table contains modifications to the base monster types. While these were created to be applied to the Cultist creature, they can be applied to any creature to create a Blessed version. When applied to a base creature, the Blessed creature keeps their original attributes and abilities, and gains the ones listed for the relevant Demon Lord, unless the creature already has a better version of the ability.</p>
<p>Because of the template nature of this table, getting an exact CR is a challenge unto itself. Playtesting has found that applying these modifications to a Cultist monster results in a creature that is roughly CR 4.</p>
<h3 id="base-modifications">
  Base Modifications
  <a class="anchor" href="#base-modifications">#</a>
</h3>
<p>All Blessed Cultists have the following modifications, unless their base creature has better, or the table says otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> Blessed Cultists have Multiattack and can hit twice with their weapon or at-will spells. Limited and recharge abilities cost the creature its whole action. Creatures with Multiattacks listed in their description gain that many additional attacks, on top of the base two.</p>
<p><strong>Armor.</strong> Blessed Cultists wear higher quality armor and thus have +3 armor.</p>
<p><strong>Health.</strong> As a boon from their patron, Blessed Cultists have an additional 8d10 health.</p>
