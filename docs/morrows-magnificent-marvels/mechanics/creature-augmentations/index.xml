      <description>The Floodslain #   We saw the stream of water, first. It flowed down the hill, bringing the leaves with it and turning everything to thick, soupy, slippery mud.
But it was the eyes that were most chilling. The orc was wild-eyed, as if frozen in fear, as were the rectangular eyes of his goats. And they were all dripping wet, as though caught in an invisible downpour so perpetual that their bodies took on the water like over-saturated rags, swelling them grotesquely and flowing from their eyes, their noses&amp;hellip;their wounds.</description>

      <description>Blessed Cultists #  Cults can crop up anywhere, but demon lord cults are especially prolific throughout the Worldwound, where many survivors either search for power through the demon lord&amp;rsquo;s favor, or hope they will provide a modicum of safety in a dangerous land.
Some particularly&amp;hellip;fortunate&amp;hellip;cultists are blessed by their demon lord and given some of their patron&amp;rsquo;s attributes. Only a handful per village are selected for this great gift, but sometimes, only a handful is more than enough.</description>
