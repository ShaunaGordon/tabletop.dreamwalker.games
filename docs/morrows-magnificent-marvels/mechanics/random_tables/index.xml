      <description>Blessed Cultists #  Cults can crop up anywhere, but demon lord cults are especially prolific throughout the Worldwound, where many survivors either search for power through the demon lord&amp;rsquo;s favor, or hope they will provide a modicum of safety in a dangerous land.
Some particularly&amp;hellip;fortunate&amp;hellip;cultists are blessed by their demon lord and given some of their patron&amp;rsquo;s attributes. Only a handful per village are selected for this great gift, but sometimes, only a handful is more than enough.</description>

      <description>The Sarkorian Steppes #   Environment: Steppe, Flatland Climate: Arctic/Subarctic Minimum Level: 6  The Sarkorian Steppes, in the westernmost region of the Worldwound, contains a fascinating assortment of creatures, due to its position as a borderland between the heart of the Worldwound and the unaffected Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Travelers through the region may see nothing but the native mammoths, elks, or even powerful rocs, while others, even following the same road, may run into any number of the demons that roam the area.</description>
