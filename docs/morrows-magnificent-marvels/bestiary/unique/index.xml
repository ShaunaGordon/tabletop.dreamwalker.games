      <description>Amiri #  One of Golarion&amp;rsquo;s iconics for good reason. We encountered her during her earlier days, when she passed through Carrion Hill in Ustalav, where she was the reining champion of the fighting pit there.
She&amp;rsquo;s quite the formidable foe, having stood toe-to-toe against our own Gorumite and nearly defeated him. In fact, she would have done so, were it not for his half-orcish tenacity.
They&amp;rsquo;re quite good friends now, with a gleeful, healthy respect for one another.</description>

      <description>Elvisar #  One of the leading bards at the school in Castle Urion, he served as my bard tutor and loose ally while I was there.
He&amp;rsquo;s a little flamboyant (okay, a lot flamboyant), has a cocky streak, and gives truth to the bard stereotype, but behind the act, does genuinely care about those he calls friend.
