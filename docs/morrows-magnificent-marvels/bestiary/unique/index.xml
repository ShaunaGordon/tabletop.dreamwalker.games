      <description>Amiri #  One of Golarion&amp;rsquo;s iconics for good reason. We encountered her during her earlier days, when she passed through Carrion Hill in Ustalav, where she was the reining champion of the fighting pit there.
She&amp;rsquo;s quite the formidable foe, having stood toe-to-toe against our own Gorumite and nearly defeated him. In fact, she would have done so, were it not for his half-orcish tenacity.
They&amp;rsquo;re quite good friends now, with a gleeful, healthy respect for one another.</description>
