Because our game is a D\u0026amp;D 5e game set in the Pathfinder universe, a number of these creatures are converted from their Pathfinder origins and given 5e stat blocks and abilities (though some have further customizations). We have also created some whole-cloth for our purposes.\nThe creatures here have been \u0026ldquo;playtested\u0026rdquo; in the sense that we have used them in our campaign and our own characters have fought against them, unless a creature is otherwise labelled.\nGame Challenges #  Most of these creatures were designed to overcome the specific challenges that our group makeup has posed. Our players are all experienced as players and most are also experienced DMs, which has resulted in fairly highly optimized and durable characters. With two Barbarians, an evasive Rogue, and an armored-to-the-teeth Paladin at its core, we tend to laugh at so-called \u0026ldquo;deadly\u0026rdquo; encounters by the usual challenge calculators. For us, \u0026ldquo;deadly\u0026rdquo; typically means \u0026ldquo;we might have to throw a heal on someone who was particularly unlucky or stupid.\u0026rdquo;\nTo add to the challenge, outside of the Barbarians and Paladin, the group is really squishy and can often be one-shot by anything that can even remotely threaten the other three. This makes it very difficult to tune encounters to really feel threatening without making it completely unfair to the squishier members.\nAs a result, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that a lot of the creatures in this book have abilities and/or spells that don\u0026rsquo;t rely so much on breaking through AC \u0026ndash; or if they do, they have a high +hit. We also make liberal use of multiattack and other creative tactics to whittle down the party\u0026rsquo;s defenses. Additionally, their configuration makes it difficult to accurately gauge their Challenge Rating and are likely on the high end for whatever rating they\u0026rsquo;re listed as, depending on your own group makeup.\n"}),a.add({id:3,href:'/docs/morrows-magnificent-marvels/mechanics/',title:"Game Master Tools",section:"Morrow's Magnificent Marvels",content:"Not everything we encounter is a person, creature, or treasure.

Until then, a potion made of Wolf\u0026rsquo;s Bane can be used to cure the person \u0026ndash; but the cure comes with risks of its own.\nThe potion that can cure early stage lycanthropy is volatile and must be made from the highly toxic Wolf\u0026rsquo;s Bane flower, must be administered before the afflicted\u0026rsquo;s first full moon, and the potion is only good for one to two weeks (and therefore cannot be made ahead of time and stockpiled indefinitely).\nGo ahead, ask me how I know all this.\nObtaining Wolf\u0026rsquo;s Bane Flowers #  In some locations, Wolf's Bane only grows during certain times of the year, which can make finding the flowers easier or more difficult.  Obtaining the key ingredient is, itself, a bit of a tricky process. It grows along forest edges, as an herbaceous, mounding plant under larger bushes. Each plant bears only a handful of flowers at any given time, though sometimes one can get lucky and find more than usual, or even a second plant in the same location. The ideal flowers are deep purple, but the plant can bear colors ranging from pale to medium yellow and any shade of purple. Any of the lighter colors are more toxic than the deep purple, without any additional potency against the curse, and while a potion can still be made with them, they should be avoided by all but the most durable of party members, and even still, used only if absolutely necessary.\nAdditionally, between the highly toxic nature of the plants, and the time it takes to find, identify, and harvest the flowers, no more than three rounds of gathering can happen per long rest, and if the group must move to a new search area, that uses the time for a round of gathering, leaving the group with just two rounds. Each successful round nets 1d4 flowers.\nLocating, Identifying, and Harvesting #  A successful gathering round consists of three steps, each with their own skill check. The checks are done consecutively, and a failed Perception or Investigation check fails the entire round. Nature checks can optionally have a \u0026ldquo;soft fail\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;hard fail.\u0026rdquo;\nOptional Rule: Soft Failing Nature Checks #  Failed Nature checks can still yield flowers, but unusable (DC minus 6+) or yellow ones (DC minus 1-5). Yellow flowers can still be used to make a potion, but death save DC increases by 1 for every yellow flower used.\n  Find a candidate bush to look under (Perception) Find the plant and its flowers (Investigation) Identify and harvest the flowers (Nature)  The DC for the skill checks start at 10 + the searcher\u0026rsquo;s skill bonus. Different characters can be used for each task, and if the characters are given a reference drawing of the flower, or other identification information, the initial Nature check DC can be reduced by 2.\nOptional Rule: Critical Successes #  The GM may choose to reward critical successes on any or all of the checks. When doing so, the following modifications can be made:\n Perception check grants two Investigation/Nature check cycles in the same round. Investigation check grants two Nature checks in the same round. Nature check yields an additional 1d4 flowers.  Improved Identification And Resource Depletion #  In addition to the base DC level, successes on rounds can make finding flowers easier or more difficult.\n For every 2 successful rounds, Nature DC reduces by 1 For every 3 successes in the same area, Investigation DC increases by 1. This DC resets when the group moves to a new search area. For every 4 successful rounds, Perception DC reduces by 1 For every 4 successful rounds overall, starting Investigation DC for a new area decreases by 1  Making The Potion #  Optional Rule: Allowing Buffs #  Buffs to saving throws, such as the Bless or Resistance spells, or Bardic Inspiration, can be used to help a character succeed. The saving throws are considered separate actions. The process is considered within the 1-minute timeframe required for Bless, while Resistance and Bardic Inspiration can only be used on one of the saving throws.\n Ten flowers are needed to make each potion, and each potion takes 1d4 hours to make. The least toxic potion is made with all purple flowers (DC 10), while the most lethal is made with all yellow flowers (DC 20). The GM can determine if and how many yellow flowers can be used in a potion. The save DC increases by 1 for each yellow flower used in potion. When making multiple potions, they must be made individually, allowing for each potion to be a unique blend of flowers.\nSurviving The Potion #  Each character that drinks the potion must make up to 3 Constitution saving throws.
