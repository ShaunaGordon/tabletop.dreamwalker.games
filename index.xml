      <description>The Floodslain # We saw the stream of water, first. It flowed down the hill, bringing the leaves with it and turning everything to thick, soupy, slippery mud.
But it was the eyes that were most chilling. The orc was wild-eyed, as if frozen in fear, as were the rectangular eyes of his goats. And they were all dripping wet, as though caught in an invisible downpour so perpetual that their bodies took on the water like over-saturated rags, swelling them grotesquely and flowing from their eyes, their noses&amp;hellip;their wounds.</description>

      <description>Iomedaean Gryphon Rider # Sporting lighter armor than their ground counterparts, the Gryphon Riders of Castle Urion are mounted Knights serving as air support and long-range patrol of the castle and River Road.
Gryphons, however, are not mere steeds. As part of their training, Gryphon Riders must take an egg and incubate it as the Gryphon parents would, so that the hatchling imprints on the rider. The Gryphon remains loyal to the rider throughout their shared life, creating the deep bond and ability to act as a single unit that is required to perform the aerial acrobatics the Riders are known for.</description>

      <description>Iomedaean Knight # The Iomedaean Knights serve as the guard and ruling class of Castle Urion in southwestern Numeria. As Knights of Iomedae, they embody the typical &amp;ldquo;knight in shining armor&amp;rdquo; ideal. Their steel plate and (typically) greatsword are crafted to appear nearly white, save for their red gold accents, and kept highly polished.
Variant: Defensive # Defensive Knights forego the greatsword of most knights in favor of the more stereotypical longsword and shield, granting them additional protection at the expense of a little damage output.</description>

      <description>Amiri # One of Golarion&amp;rsquo;s iconics for good reason. We encountered her during her earlier days, when she passed through Carrion Hill in Ustalav, where she was the reining champion of the fighting pit there.
She&amp;rsquo;s quite the formidable foe, having stood toe-to-toe against our own Gorumite and nearly defeated him. In fact, she would have done so, were it not for his half-orcish tenacity.
They&amp;rsquo;re quite good friends now, with a gleeful, healthy respect for one another.</description>

      <description>Blessed Cultists # Cults can crop up anywhere, but demon lord cults are especially prolific throughout the Worldwound, where many survivors either search for power through the demon lord&amp;rsquo;s favor, or hope they will provide a modicum of safety in a dangerous land.
Some particularly&amp;hellip;fortunate&amp;hellip;cultists are blessed by their demon lord and given some of their patron&amp;rsquo;s attributes. Only a handful per village are selected for this great gift, but sometimes, only a handful is more than enough.</description>

      <description>Caroliss Minerran # Commander Caroliss Minerran leads the Iomedaean knights that rule the settlement of Castle Urion in Numeria. As such, she balances her oath to Iomedae, her deal with the Black Sovereign, and her own morals.
We ran into her when a vampire hunter came after me (long story), and it was her oath tenets of honor and compassion that saved us&amp;hellip;until one of my guys caused trouble at the inn later that evening (uh&amp;hellip;also a long story).</description>

      <description>Elvisar # One of the leading bards at the school in Castle Urion, he served as my bard tutor and loose ally while I was there.
He&amp;rsquo;s a little flamboyant (okay, a lot flamboyant), has a cocky streak, and gives truth to the bard stereotype, but behind the act, does genuinely care about those he calls friend.

      <guid>//tabletop.dreamwalker.games/docs/morrows-magnificent-marvels/bestiary/technic/collector/</guid>
      <description>Technic Collector Bot # Collector Bots are designed for one purpose &amp;ndash; collect and study everything. These peaceful constructs don&amp;rsquo;t pose much of a mortal threat, since its stun gun is used solely to incapacitate a target, the only potentially lethal part is its claw slam, and even that would be accidental unless the bot is malfunctioning.
When it comes to living creatures, the bot&amp;rsquo;s primary directive is &amp;ldquo;catch, tag, and release,&amp;rdquo; using its claw slam to catch its target so that it can inject a tracking chip under the skin, then release it to observe and record its behaviors, and finally catch it later for additional study.</description>

      <description>Technic Hydra # Like their organic counterparts, Technic Hydras have multiple heads that regrow when severed. Instead of fire, though, these creatures need a lightning attack to disrupt their nanotech and prevent regrowth.
Similar to the Myrmidons, the Hydra has the ability to focus its electrical energy into a single beam of lightning, though the Hydra&amp;rsquo;s is powerful enough to paralyze at range. The general consensus of those who study this creature (and live to tell about it) is that it uses this ability to aid in hunting and bringing down prey.</description>

      <description>Technic Myrmidon # Resembling a flying humanoid, even the aberrant Myrmidon can be a formidable foe. Its laser tentacles can paralyze its target, leaving the victim vulnerable to other attacks.
When fully functional, the Myrmidon is no laughing matter. As intelligent as most humanoids, with the power to create a force shield for extra protection, and to lash out with its tentacles or generate an electrical pulse to hit enemies at range, the Myrmidon can pose a real threat to anyone who stumbles upon one.</description>

      <description>Technic Spiderbot # More annoying than dangerous to anyone who has grown beyond a commoner, unless they swarm. And swarm they do. Spiderbots generally appear in packs of no less than four.
These creatures are about the size of a large dog, with a body resembling a scorpion. Pincers on the front lash out to attack those in melee, while the spiked tail can either lash out in a melee attack, or open up to reveal small laser guns to hit targets at range.</description>

      <description>The Sarkorian Steppes # Environment: Steppe, Flatland Climate: Arctic/Subarctic Minimum Level: 6 The Sarkorian Steppes, in the westernmost region of the Worldwound, contains a fascinating assortment of creatures, due to its position as a borderland between the heart of the Worldwound and the unaffected Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Travelers through the region may see nothing but the native mammoths, elks, or even powerful rocs, while others, even following the same road, may run into any number of the demons that roam the area.</description>

      <guid>//tabletop.dreamwalker.games/docs/morrows-magnificent-marvels/mechanics/wolfsbane/</guid>
      <description>Wolf&amp;rsquo;s Bane # The curse of lycanthropy doesn&amp;rsquo;t take over immediately; a full moon is needed to cement its hold over a person. Until then, a potion made of Wolf&amp;rsquo;s Bane can be used to cure the person &amp;ndash; but the cure comes with risks of its own.
The potion that can cure early stage lycanthropy is volatile and must be made from the highly toxic Wolf&amp;rsquo;s Bane flower, must be administered before the afflicted&amp;rsquo;s first full moon, and the potion is only good for one to two weeks (and therefore cannot be made ahead of time and stockpiled indefinitely).</description>
